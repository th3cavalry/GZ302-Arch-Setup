# GZ302 Linux Setup - Python Conversion Summary

## Conversion Complete ✅ - Version 4.2

The bash script has been successfully converted to Python while maintaining 100% feature parity. This marks the release of Version 4.2 with the new Python implementation.

## Files Added
- `gz302_setup.py` - Complete Python version (1,111 lines)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (none - uses stdlib only)

## Files Modified
- `README.md` - Updated documentation for both versions
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced to exclude Python build artifacts

chmod +x gz302_setup.py
sudo ./gz302_setup.py
```

**Bash Version (Original):**
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/th3cavalry/GZ302-Linux-Setup/main/gz302_setup.sh -o gz302_setup.sh
chmod +x gz302_setup.sh
sudo ./gz302_setup.sh
```

## Hardware Fixes Implemented

All critical GZ302 hardware fixes are preserved in both versions:

- **Wi-Fi**: MediaTek MT7925e stability fixes
